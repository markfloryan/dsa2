<a name="headtas"></a>Instructor and Head TAs
------------------------------------------

We have one instructor and three **Head TAs** for this course. Their names and emails are shown in the table below. Each head TA is responsible for a specific category (e.g., grading, office hours, etc.). Students should always **contact the relevant head ta first**, as the primary point of contact regarding issues in each category. Instructors are often slow at responding and the head TAs can more quickly address your concern or escalate the situation to an instructor if necessary.

<a name="officehours"></a>Office Hours Description and Schedule
------------------------------------------

Office hours are held in various locations throughout the week and are of varying type. Information can be found below. There are two possible locations for office hours:

- **In-Person OH**: Some OH will be held in-person (in Thornton Stacks). See the chart below for details. These will function as *traditional* office hours.

- **Online (Discord) OH**: Some OH will be held on our **Discord Server**. To attend office hours, simply join the office hours queue voice channel and you will be added to the office hours queue. When you are taken off the queue you will be automatically moved to a staging room to wait (it is called *oh-up-next* or similar). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

- **Group OH**: These are weekly discussion sections where a TA will answer general questions regarding homeworks, quizzes, algorithm intution, etc. to larger groups of attendees.

2. Fork this repository: you can click on the "Fork" link in the upper right
3. Clone your forked repository on to your local machine
4. Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and push your changes back to your forked repository
5. Create a pull request, following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

At that point, we will receive a notice that a change has been submitted, and I'll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main repository.

<a name="description"></a>Course Description
--------------------------------------------

Builds upon previous analysis of algorithms and the effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such as searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and machine learning. Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions.
