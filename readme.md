<a name="contents"></a>Office Hours Description and Schedule
------------------------------------------

Office hours are held in various locations throughout the week and are of varying type. Information can be found below. There are two possible locations for office hours:

- **In-Person OH**: Some OH will be held in-person (location TBD). See the chart below for details. These will function as *traditional* office hours.

- **Discord OH**: Some OH will be held on our **Discord Server**. To attend office hours, simply join the office hours queue voice channel and you will be added to the office hours queue. When you are taken off the queue you will be automatically moved to a staging room to wait (it is called *oh-up-next* or similar). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

In addition, there are **three types of office hours**. These are described below:

- **General OH**: TAs will be available to help with the topic of the week, each week throughout the semester. These function as *traditional* office hours you would likely have in any other class.

- **Topic-Focused OH**: Office hours dedicated to one of the ten topics of the course. The TA for these topics will focus on helping students with that topic ONLY all semester. Their goal is to be the best resource for their specific topic (as much as possible). These are meant for students who are ahead in the course or who fall behing in the course and get can't help at general office hours.

- **Group OH**: These are two weekly discussion sections where a TA will answer general questions regarding homeworks, quizzes, algorithm intution, etc. to larger groups of attendees.

<a name="description"></a>Course Description
--------------------------------------------

Introduces the analysis of algorithms and the effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such as sorting, searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include heaps and search, splay, and spanning trees. Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst-case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions between problems.
