<a name="introduction"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

Module 1's quiz is on lectures and readings from Feb. 1 through Feb. 24.  The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it before the quiz in response to student questions.  See the slides and recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics.  A basic rule we'll try to follow is this: if it's in the readings, but we didn't mention it in lecture, it will *not* be on the quiz.

<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be
Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p>The quizzes will first be given on paper and in-class on 11/16/2021.
You can try one or all of the quizzes in the class that day. On the 2nd
quiz day, last week of class (watch for an update) you can re-take any
or all of these. You can also re-take any or all of these during the
final exam period.</p>
<p>The quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, etc. Getting
information from any electronic devices is not allowed while taking a
quiz. You will sign a pledge on each quiz paper.</p>
<p>It is an honor violation to communicate information about the quiz to
anyone who might not have yet taken it.</p>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-6-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 6 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and Prim’s MST algorithm
<ul>
<li>For both, the overall strategy, use of priority-queue, updating info
about connections to nodes that might be selected next, differences
between the two</li>
<li>Why decrease-key operation affects our time-complexity</li>
<li>How to use indirect heaps to make decrease-key more efficient</li>
<li>Overall time-complexity for Dijkstra’s and Prim’s</li>
<li>Possibly questions on proof strategy for these, including exchange
argument approach</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Module 6 Homework: could be some questions based on the HW
questions</li>
</ul>
<h2

that might be covered on the Module 7 quiz include:</h2>

<li>Optimal substructure property for the problem the algorithm
solves</li>
<li>Time and space complexity for the algorithm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Greedy Algorithms (general topics)
<ul>
<li>Terminology: optimization problems, feasible solutions, objective
function, optimal solutions, etc.</li>
<li>Greedy choice property (greedy choice): what this means, and what it
is for each algorithm we studied</li>
<li>Why Dijkstra’s and Prim’s are greedy algorithms</li>

coin-set. (For a given range, assume item chosen by greedy is not in
optimal solution, then show a contradiction, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Module 7 Homework: could be some questions about the Daycare problem
definition and what you’re asked to solve, but you should be able to
answer these even if your current solution isn’t working completely</li>
