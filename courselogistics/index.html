<h2 id="syllabus"><a name="syllabus"></a>Syllabus</h2>
<p>The syllabus for the course can be found <a
href="./syllabus.pdf">here</a>. Most (but not all) of that information
is summarized here.</p>
<h2 id="lectures"><a name="lectures"></a>Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures will be held in-person in the classroom listed on the
University Registrar. Lectures will be recorded for the convenience of
those who cannot intend or prefer not to for any reason. At the time of
writing, mask mandates have been repealed and wearing a mask in lecture
is optional.</p>
<h2 id="covid-19-policies-and-faq"><a name="covid"></a>Covid-19 Policies
and FAQ</h2>
<p>Everyone please read this page on <a href="./covid.html">policies and
information about how Covid-19 will affect our course</a>.</p>
<h2 id="textbook"><a name="textbook"></a>Textbook</h2>
<p>You will really need to read and study material other than the
slides. There are many choices where you can get more details about our
topics, but a textbook is the easiest option.</p>
<p>We’ll post readings from the following textbook, and we urge you to
read them or get that info from another source.</p>
<p><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by Cormen, et. al., 3rd edition.
Referred to as “CLRS”. UVA Library has a digital version of CLRS
available <a
href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775">online for
free</a></p>
<h2 id="quizzes"><a name="lectures"></a>Quizzes</h2>
<p>The course is divided into <strong>8 modules</strong>, each which
lasts for about 5 lectures (almost 2 weeks). The 8 modules are listed
below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1: Graphs - Introduction</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 2: Graphs - Advanced</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 3: Divide and Conquer Algorithms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 4: Greedy Algorithms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 5: Dynamic Programming</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 6: Network Flow / Bi-Partite Matching</strong></li>
<li><strong><del>Module 7: NP-Completeness</del></strong> (NOTE:
Canceled! Everyone earns free high pass)</li>
<li><strong><del>Module 8: Machine Learning Algorithms</del></strong>
(NOTE: Canceled! Everyone earns free high pass)</li>
</ul>
<p>The course contains exactly <strong>8 quizzes</strong> (one per
module). Each quiz can be taken multiple times, and each quiz can be in
one of 3 states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incomplete</strong>: The quiz has not been passed to any
level of satisfaction yet.</li>
<li><strong>Pass</strong>: The student has shown sufficient knowledge in
this topic area. The grade on this quiz was at least <strong>70 percent
(e.g., 14/20)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>High Pass</strong>: The student has shown significant or
near perfect knowledge in this topic area. The grade on this quiz was at
least <strong>90 percent (e.g., 18/20)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will always earn your <strong>highest mark</strong> on any quiz
across all attempts. So, there is never any reason not to attempt a quiz
if you are unsatisfied with your grade (your grade can never
decrease).</p>
<h2 id="final-exam"><a name="final"></a>Final Exam</h2>
<p>There is no traditional final exam in this course. During the final
exam time, you will be given one last attempt at all <del>8</del> (6) of
the course quizzes. This is your last chance to pass any quizzes that
are still outstanding. If you have passed all topics (or are already
happy with your final grade), then you may choose not to take the
final.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks"><a name="homeworks"></a>Homeworks</h2>
<p>There are <strong>one or two homework assignments per module
(depending on the module)</strong>, that must be completed in order to
pass that module (more on passing modules in a moment). The homeworks in
this course were designed with the following goals / principles in
mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal 1</strong>: Homework should be somewhat low-stress to
pass, but provide opportunity for deep, reflective practice with the
material.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2</strong>: Every student should be required to show
effort / progress on homework. Essentially, a student should provide
evidence of engaging with the homework even if the quality of the work
is not yet perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3</strong>: Homeworks should be submittable at any time
during the semester.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons the homework in this course is required, with
recommended deadlines (with automatic extensions), and can be submitted
as many times as required. The grading state for each assignment is one
of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incomplete</strong>: The student has not yet shown clear
effort and engagement with the assignment. The homework is not at a
passing level yet.</li>
<li><strong>Pass</strong>: The assignment is at a passing level, though
may not be perfect or mastered yet. The student is encouraged to
continue engaging with perfecting the assignment even though they have
passed (if applicable). The correlates to an <strong>80% or higher score
on a homework assignment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="passing-a-module"><a name="passing"></a>Passing a Module</h2>
<p>As stated earlier, the course contains <strong>8 modules</strong>.
Each module, at any time, is always in one of the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incomplete</strong>: At least one of the homeworks or quiz
for this module is still incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Pass</strong>: There are two ways to pass a module. One of
the following must be true:
<ul>
<li>All homeworks AND the quiz have both been passed. The quiz is NOT at
the high pass level.</li>
<li>One or more homework is Incomplete AND the quiz has been
high-passed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>High Pass</strong>: The homeworks are all passed AND the
quiz is passed at the <em>high-pass level</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-letter-grades"><a name="lettergrades"></a>Final Letter
Grades</h2>
<p>Your letter grade in this course corresponds to the number
<strong>MODULES you have passed</strong> (Note this is
<strong>MODULES</strong> passed, not homeworks or quizzes. To pass a
module, you must pass ALL the homework AND the quiz in that module).
Please note the following things when reading this grading chart:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breadth matters more than depth</strong>: Note that passing
MORE modules is amost always better than increasing a passing module
from <em>pass</em> to <em>high pass</em>. For example, if you have 7
modules passed (2 of which are high-pass). Then passing a new module
will raise your grade to a <em>B-</em>, while raising an old module to
high-pass will raise your grade to only a <em>C+</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Depth starts to matter more once you reach a B-</strong>:
Once you reach a grade of <em>B-</em>, getting the modules to the
high-pass level matters more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 11/15/22 - Everybody earns one free high-pass (module
8). Make sure to take this into account when calculating your
grade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 11/18/22 - Everybody will earn a free high-pass on
module 7 as well. Remember to account for this when calculating your
grade (everyone has 2 modules passed, 2 of them high-pass BEFORE
considering hw and quizzes passed during the semester.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>blank row</strong> translates to <em>No change from the
row above</em>. This makes the table easier to read.</li>
<li>The number of modules at <strong>high pass</strong> is NOT
summative. For example, the row for <strong>B</strong> says 8 modules
passed, and 3 of those 8 must be at the high-pass level (It is NOT the
case that you need 3 additional modules at the high-pass level)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-on-nc-gc-cr"><a name="lettergrades"></a>Policy on NC / GC
/ CR</h2>
<p>As most of you know, the University is allowing students to translate
their grades from <strong>letter grades</strong> to
<strong>pass/fail</strong> grades AFTER you see your final grade. The
process for requesting and making this change will be handled by the
registrar and not by instructors. This section highlights some general
issues regarding this that you should be aware of.</p>

<p>We will <strong>not be making any alterations to our grading
policy</strong> and your grade will be submitted as specified in the
previous section.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>In CS, we require a <strong>C- or better</strong> OR
<strong>CR</strong> to meet prerequisites for future CS courses. This
means that if you earn a grade of C-, you need to be deliberate about
whether you choose to convert that C- into a GC or not. We have a
separate recommendation depending on which curriculum track you are on
(see below).</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-on-the-old-curriculum-i.e.-you-took-cs2150">If you
are on the OLD curriculum (i.e., you took CS2150)</h3>
<p>If you took CS2150 and are on the old curriculum, then DSA2 is
<strong>not a prerequisite for any future CS course</strong>. This means
that if you earn a C-, you can safely change it into a GC if you’d like
without disrupting your graduation.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-on-the-new-curriculum-i.e.-you-took-dsa1">If you are
on the NEW curriculum (i.e., you took DSA1)</h3>
<p>If you are on the new curriculum then DSA1 <strong>IS a prerequisite
for future CS courses</strong>. If you earn a C-, then you have a
(possibly difficult) choice to make. Your C- will allow you to continue
to work towards the major, but will hurt your GPA. A GC will help your
GPA, but will mean you need to retake that class to meet the
prerequisite requirement. This is, of course, up to you.</p>
